Title: AITA for not telling my family about my pregnancy?

I (40F) just recently found out that I am pregnant. Like... 8 months pregnant at this point. My fiancé (40M) and I weren't ever planning on having children. I have never wanted kids of my own and have always been up-front about this with my family and friends.

Due to a series of bizarre medical events, I ended up pregnant despite long-term use of very effective (for me) birth control. I didn't know because a medication masked basically all the symptoms of early pregnancy. It was a fluke that I found out at 28 weeks -- and it wasn’t a happy surprise. I spent several days in complete hysterics.

Now, a month later, I have come to terms for the most part. At this point there's nothing to do but finish this strange and unplanned journey. My fiancé and I have decided to pursue adoption through a very good agency. We're doing all the right things for the baby medically and we think we're doing the right thing with the adoption as well. We believe that kids deserve a family who is excited for them and delighted by them... and we can't give this child that experience.

Here's where we may be AHs. We have told only the people closest to us about the pregnancy and our plans. This includes our closest friends and confidants... but only includes two members of my family, namely two that I thought would support us without pressuring us to do anything aside from what we've chosen. We're both close to my family as a whole, but they can be... pushy. The other members of my extended family are very religious and honestly pretty judgmental. I think they would probably "mean well" but would actually end up stressing both myself and my fiancé out during a time that's already stressful.

Of course, this means shutting them out of everything. No part in the birth, no information about the adoption, nothing. I know this would hurt them if they knew, but I think protecting my peace is priority right now.
