Title: AITAH for not wanting to see my dad anymore because I don’t feel his sympathy for me?

I (Asian) am married to my daughter’s dad (he’s white and honestly, an AH with mental health issues), but my family doesn’t know about it. My parents are currently visiting me here in the US.

Lately, I’ve been seeing my husband 2–3 times a week these past few weeks, and my parents aren’t happy about it. They think I’m putting our lives at risk every time we see him.

Here’s what’s been happening:

I left him 10 days after giving birth because he wasn’t helping me with anything. I’ve been living with my family since then.

My daughter and I met with him outside our place. He wasn’t happy about how our daughter looked and started talking to me like he was scolding me. I didn’t know my dad had come outside too. My husband didn’t even greet him, just went straight to his car and drove off.

Another time, my daughter and I went with him to visit his sick grandma (she hadn’t met our daughter yet). We stayed overnight at a hotel. Around 3 AM, he suddenly wanted me to call the police because he said he didn’t feel safe. He ended up checking himself into the hospital for a mental health crisis, leaving me and our baby at the hotel. My dad freaked out when he found out because the police got involved. Back home, anything involving the police is seen as a huge deal. I explained what really happened, but they didn’t believe me.

After that third incident, my parents sat me down to ask what my plans were. I told them how I felt and said I wasn’t going back to live with my husband. I even said I’d move in with my sister until I found out she’s pregnant with her third child, so I changed my mind.

A month later, I started seeing my husband more often, and my parents weren’t happy about it. My mom asked again what my plans were with my daughter, saying if I keep seeing my daughter’s dad, there must still be “feelings involved.” (Like, wtf? Why do they even care if there are feelings involved? AITAH for that?!) I told her clearly we’re not getting back together.

Then one day, I told my dad I was meeting my husband again, with our daughter. He immediately got mad. Maybe because I’m being “stubborn”? He yelled at me, saying I’d be asking for rescue again, that they’ve “rescued us twice already,” and that I’m putting my daughter’s life in danger. He started pointing his finger at me and shouting that he wouldn’t allow it. I snapped and told him he has no right to control my life especially when he’s the one going back to our home country for his mistress. My mom got upset over what I said, and my dad called me disrespectful. Still, I left with my daughter.

He said he just feels sorry for me because of what I’ve gone through with my daughter’s dad. But honestly? I don’t feel any sympathy from him because he’s been cheating and hiding things from our family for years. Because of that, I don’t even want to see him anymore. He even blocked me on social media and IDGAF about it.

Edit: I didn’t actually asked for a rescue. He calls it rescue for volunteering to pick us up even if I insisted that we can take an uber. My dad didn’t tell me that he’s sorry for my situation, it’s just a conversation of him and my mom.
