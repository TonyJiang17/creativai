Title: Am i the Asshole for wanting my girlfriebd to me mature emotionally

Okay, so my (30m) girlfriend (21f) has decided its okay to stonewall me and be distant to me in our relationship. The other day i was hanging out with my friend Turner.

I told her i was going to his house. I was there for 5 hours and for three of those hours i lost track of what was happening on my phone and accidentally ignored her for 3 hours. It was not my intention. My friend Turner has severe ADHD and can talk for like 40 minutes straight. A lot of people find this annoying but i love the guy as a brother and i know he cant help it even if he tried. So to show him i care, and that im paying attention i try to not look at or be on my phone when he talks.

She came at me upset because her ex would dissapear for hours while cheating on her. I told her that i was sorry. Her feelings are valid and i know where she is coming from. I told her id put more of an effort in making sure i reply to her instead of leaving her on read like how i did. However since then she has been distant and cold. I tried to bring it up with her but she just keeps saying "I lowered my defenses and now i have to put them back up. Ive told you why im being distant." But i keep telling her its not healthy, its not appropriate, and its doing nothing but pushing us away from each other. At this point its been 3 days and she wont budge.

Im thinking i should just break up with her and just enjoy being single again for a bit. We have only been together for a month and i just feel if this is how she is going to be now, its only going to get worse. Id rather just end it now than keep trying and being hurt, for it to just fall apart again in a few months or years.

Am i the ass hole? And for context im aware the 9 year age gap seems weird. I wasnt into her because of her age, i acctually thought she was 24 or 25 when we first started talking and dating. I typically wont date anyone younger than 25.
