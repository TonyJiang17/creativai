Title: AITA for being annoyed with my boyfriend for only ever talking about hunting?

I have been dating my boyfriend for three years and we moved in together recently. He got back into hunting (deer, elk, turkey) and I swear to god.. every conversation we have he relates it back to wild life or a hunting story. He goes into lengthy detail about where he went, what he saw, how many scrapes there were, how many prongs on each antler of every buck, what kind of calls he used, the weight of his arrows, he will go on for what seems like hours without any input from me. I usually just nod and mm and wow while doing other stuff around the house, half listening.

He is passionate about it, and I want to be supportive, it just doesn’t interest me other than the fact that he likes it and i want him to do what he enjoys just as i want to pursue my passions.

So, does it make me an asshole to be annoyed by his passion? Is there a way to gently tell him that I don’t need to know every single detail of every single outing he goes on without being condescending? Or is this just part of my relationship and I need to stop being self centered?
