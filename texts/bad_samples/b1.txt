title: AITA for telling my mom to back off?

A few years ago I was friends with this lady, our mothers then became best friends which is great. I stopped talking to her after I brought a boyfriend at the time to one of her parties and they ended up hooking up. My mom and her mom stayed best friends and I never really spoke about why I stopped speaking to her so no one fully understands, which I feel is none of their business really. My mom keeps inviting this lady over whenever I'm visiting even if her mom isn't here and then tells me like a child to go greet her and keep her company. I have basic respect and will go greet her but then I end up either walking away or leaving. My mom said I was rude and need to get over whatever happened between us and I told her to back off. She is pretty upset at my response and said she just wants us all to be able to spend time together but I have absolutely no interest. I'm over the whole situation that happened back then but I just don't see myself being friends with someone who would do that. AITA or being immature?
