Title: WIBTAH if I dont go to the Christmas party

Our franchise owner has five stores, so all five stores meet at a mid point location for the yearly Christmas party. I didnt attend last year and I wasnt planning on it this year either, but my coworkers are insisting. It's gonna be the same as last year, free dinner and drinks and carnival style games with prizes. The idea of it doesnt sound bad but the location is somewhat out of my way. It would mean driving in the dark, in winter, to an unfamiliar town. I get motion sickness as a passenger so getting a ride is off the table, which also means I can't drink to get through it lol.. so yeah, wibtah if I don't go?
