Title: AITA for refusing a job due to my daughter's security?

This account is new because my main was banned wrongfully and I'm appealing.

I am a 33yo single mother and I live with my daughter and our seven cats. We left another city in February due to DV, and restarting hasn't been easy.

I work with digital illustrations - and I also work as a translator and ghostwriter -, and sometimes we go through really hard times because my earnings are not constant. Right now, we have food only for today, and I have nothing to feed my cats besides a last can of sardines.

I've come to Reddit before for help, but most of the responses I got told me to get a job. Even when I tried to explain that this was one of the worst options, I searched for any job I could find, and I did. It's a minimum wage job.

Then all the problems with it that I've foreseen all along came. I don't have a safe net that I can count on to look after my daughter, and I have two options:

Paying someone to look after her, and then making enough money just to cover rent;

Leaving my 9yo daughter at home by herself.

I live in a dangerous part of my city, and in the house we live in right now the door and gate have no locks, so there's a huge risk leaving a child home alone (and also illegal in my country until 14yo). Here we have a lot of users, and almost daily we hear about people breaking in to steal and things worse.

I'm supposed to start on Monday, but it would mean not only leaving my daughter alone from 7h30 until 20h, but it also would mean stop enterily with my side jobs, and food would be scarce until I get paid.

I honestly don't think this would be the best option, and I'm afraid something happens to my daughter. I've been posting about my work anywhere I can, and I'm trying to stay by my baby's side, but I'm afraid I'm not making the right choice. I'm already waiting on government assistance, but it can take months.
