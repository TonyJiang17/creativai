Title: AITAH for leading my friend on

I'm keeping this vague because the guy who this post is about uses Reddit. But basically I (college-age F) and a guy I'm sorta friends with (college-age M) have had a little something going on basically since we met last month. We're not dating and I don't predict this will turn into a relationship but we're both attracted to each other and the other day some stuff happened. By that I mean we made out, took clothes off, etc etc but we didn't go all the way. I have a personal boundary that I won't have s*x outside of a relationship. I haven't explicitly told him this because I didn't think it was necessary to share. I didn't think things were actually going to go that far that quick. But it's a boundary I have that I'm not going to change.

So when we were making out I stopped it before it turned into s*x. I could tell that made him upset and he hasn't really been talking to me since then. I don't think me having a boundary is wrong but I do wonder if I accidentally led him on and that's what he's upset about. Because to be fair I was the one that suggested we hang out in his room, when he said that he wanted to hook up I agreed and started to go along with it, and I didn't tell him that I was never going to have sex with him. To be completely honest I was worried he was going to lose interest in me if I told him that. Cause I do like him and I don't mind fooling around a little bit, I just have specific boundaries about how far I'll go. But I feel like I might have been a little manipulative and I feel bad about that.
