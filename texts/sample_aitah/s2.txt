Title: AITA for telling wife not to cover up for her friend's cheating?

She (28F) lives a bit far but her office is near our place. She has many times stayed over if she had too much work. Her wedding was coming up in few months at the time.

My wife got a call early in morning one day from her. She was hurriedly telling her to tell her husband that she stayed with us for the the night. After the call wife told me and I told her not to cover up for it. She said she will think about it and went about her work.

Her fiance never called and I remembered it again when we got the invitation for her wedding. I brought it up again and expressed how dissappinted I was with her friend. I told her she cannot cover up for her cheating and she was hesistant saying it doesnt affect us. When I told her its something that will affect our relationship she chose to not go to wedding out of fear of having to talk about it.

She now blames me for making her miss the wedding. All I said was if she covers up for her I would feel differently about her and I cant know how differently. She decided it was better to not go to the wedding at all. Was I wrong to demand her to he truthful?
