Title: Wife has been working in “sales” 100% commission for the past 9 months. She hasn’t made a penny.

Title sums up the situation. She spends 6-7 hours a day and demands to be uninterrupted in her home office. We have 3 kids and I work full time paying for everything, getting off work at noon. So as soon am I’m home she’s MIA until dinner time. It’s really starting to piss me off because she has literally not made a single penny and she even has to spend money to buy her own leads. I wouldn’t care if she didn’t have a job at all and was just a stay at home mother. It’s the hiding in her office or too busy to do any chores or spend time with the family while listening to “agent academy” or other motivational lectures from team leaders. She claims I don’t support her. I did at first but it’s very difficult after 9 months with literally negative profit. AITA for complaining about this?

***Update - Really appreciate everyone’s advice. We had a long fight, then talk. I think she sees the light now. She is going to use her insurance license to look for a real opportunity, so at least there was a bright side to starting this. She admitted she didn’t see a future here but felt like she couldn’t just give up and admit defeat. She is going to stop buying leads from them and use some of the alternate lead generating sites people recommended here to keep practicing while she job hunts. It did help her a lot with her social and emotional growth I think. She has realized it was scratching an itch to just do something and be something more. I understand that aspect and am helping her find a new outlet. She even worked out with me for the first time! I think we made a good compromise for going forward. Hopefully all turns out well.
