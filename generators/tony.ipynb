She also had a second savings account she wanted to add to it. This was on top of what the two of us had saved for him before her illness. I honored her wishes and I continued saving for our son's future. This is a promise I made to my late wife that I have stood by. I also promised I would protect it and make sure it was only ever for him, nobody else.\n",

    "When my present wife and I started seriously dating we talked about what saving would look like for our kids if/when we married. She knew I had always saved as had my late wife. We didn't discuss how much either of us had saved for our existing kids but we agreed to an amount every month that would be saved for all three and this was talked about again when we had children together.\n",

    "Recently there has been a lot of stress on my wife. Her ex has refused to discuss my stepkids savings and if he pays anything or not.

I told her I would happily discuss what I have saved for my oldest, but I would not be discussing the money left by his mom. She pushed back on it and said all the money should be taken into consideration. I told her we don't know what all the money is. I said our parents could be saving money for the kids' futures, her ex could have money for my stepkids, his parents could have money for my stepkids. We can't say for certainty what everyone will have at the end and it's only fair to discuss what she and I have and can save.\n",

That our younger two are probably going to be the worst off long term and she would be open to combining all the money and dividing it.

    "because I won't tell my wife what my son/her stepson has in savings from my late wife?\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll own that I’m not the most relaxed person about money. But I have reasons. My late wife asked me to safeguard a chunk of her settlement and her personal savings for our son. I promised her I would make sure it was there for him when he needed it, no strings, no “loans.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward: I married my current wife, who has two kids. We agreed to contribute monthly to all the kids’ futures. We’ve been trying, but life has been expensive. Recently she said, “Let’s stop guessing and put actual numbers on the table for all five kids.” I agreed to go through everything we’ve contributed as a couple and what I’ve put into our joint children’s accounts. But I declined to disclose the total that came from my late wife and the exact number my son has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why I’m stuck: two years ago our house flooded and we were scrambling. My wife pulled money out of her two kids’ accounts “just until the insurance check cleared.” I didn’t sign off; she did it while I was traveling. She paid back most of it, but not all, and her ex was furious when he found out. It created a huge blowup, therapy, rules, the whole thing. We agreed after that: no touching kids’ money and no using the kids’ accounts to solve adult emergencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when she tells me now that knowing my son’s number would help us be “more fair,” my brain goes straight to that day. I don’t think she’s a thief. I think she’s a fixer under pressure who will rationalize “borrowing from future us” when things get scary. And once the number is out there, it can’t be untold. It changes the dynamic for my son too—he’s already anxious about people expecting him to “share.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She says I’m punishing her forever for a mistake and treating her like an outsider. I told her it’s not about punishment; it’s about a boundary I set long before we married, one I’m responsible for keeping. I also pointed out that there are unknowns on her side too—maybe her ex has savings for their kids, maybe grandparents are quietly contributing. It’s not just my son who might have “extra.” The only ethical way I see this is to plan using the accounts we jointly control and keep contributing evenly going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it’s icy in our house. She says I’m withholding critical information that affects family planning. I think telling her would just load a target on my son’s back for years—every crisis becomes a referendum on whether he should “help the family.” I suggested a neutral financial mediator and even offered to let her see the attorney who set up my son’s accounts without the dollar figure disclosed, so she understands the restrictions.
