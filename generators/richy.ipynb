    "\n",
    "When my late wife was sick she told me she wanted a percent of the compensation she was issued for her medical misdiagnosis to go to our son's savings. She also had a second savings account she wanted to add to it. This was on top of what the two of us had saved for him before her illness. I honored her wishes and I continued saving for our son's future. This is a promise I made to my late wife that I have stood by. I also promised I would protect it and make sure it was only ever for him, nobody else.\n",
    "\n",
    "When my present wife and I started seriously dating we talked about what saving would look like for our kids if/when we married. She knew I had always saved as had my late wife. We didn't discuss how much either of us had saved for our existing kids but we agreed to an amount every month that would be saved for all three and this was talked about again when we had children together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently there has been a lot of stress on my wife. Her ex has refused to discuss my stepkids savings and if he pays anything or not. She also feels like we haven't been able to save enough every month like promised because it was just one thing after another. There are month's we've missed because of things beyond our control. Life stuff mostly like things breaking, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few weeks ago my wife told me we should put all the cards on the table and discuss what all five kids have and decide how we proceed with making sure everyone gets what they need for the future. I told her I would happily discuss what I have saved for my oldest, but I would not be discussing the money left by his mom. She pushed back on it and said all the money should be taken into consideration. I told her we don't know what all the money is. I said our parents could be saving money for the kids' futures, her ex could have money for my stepkids, his parents could have money for my stepkids. We can't say for certainty what everyone will have at the end and it's only fair to discuss what she and I have and can save.\n",
    "\n",
    "She told me it sounds like I don't trust her. I responded by asking why she wants to know this so badly. By only talking about what we've saved we're on an even footing. She told me if we knew everything we could focus on the kids who will have less a little more. That our younger two are probably going to be the worst off long term and she would be open to combining all the money and dividing it. I told her I was not on board with that and what my son has from his mom is not going to be shared or used for any of the other kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "We argued about it but I refused to say. She feels like that's wrong when we're married. I told her it's not my money, nor is it her money or money that we can or should be accessing. It's from my late wife to our son and that's all there is to it. My wife said she feels like I'm keeping her in the dark and not trusting her with something important. She said it cuts her ability to fully engage in conversations we need to be able to have and decisions we need to make as a couple.</ExamplePost> \n",

      "Throwaway because my main has my school name in it. I’m 30M, she’s 28F. Matched on Hinge a couple weeks ago. “Lena” is a lifestyle/content creator. I’m a middle school teacher who keeps his online presence basically nonexistent because students will absolutely find anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the start I told her I’m private and not comfortable being online. She said she “totally got it” and that she’d been keeping her dating life offline anyway. We set a plan for ramen at a trendy spot last Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day of, she texted: “My sponsor wants a ‘first date ramen’ theme — cool if I film some stuff while we’re there?” I replied, “As long as I’m not in it.” She said, “It’ll be mostly me/food. We can talk boundaries when you get there.” That felt…fine? I took “mostly” to mean maybe a shot of her slurping noodles, b-roll of the neon sign. I didn’t anticipate being part of a production.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get there and there’s a little ring light two tables over and her phone on a mini tripod pointed at her side of the booth. I sit down, we order drinks, and she’s super bubbly. A few minutes in I notice she’s talking into her phone between sentences, and comments are rolling on the screen. I ask, “Wait, are you live?” She says, “Yeah, but don’t worry, it’s only my face. You’re not on camera. My chat can just hear us a bit. It’s just part of the deliverables.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I reminded her I didn’t want to be online. She goes, “You’re not online, babe, you’re off-frame. Audio is just vibes. My sponsor needs ‘first date live Q&A’ and a few cutaways.” She laughed like I was overthinking it. I told her I wasn’t okay with being heard or included at all. She said she couldn’t shut it off mid-stream without tanking the campaign. She also said she’d paid for a sitter and had a deadline, and that it was literally her job. We had already ordered appetizers at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggested we reschedule the date part, she could do her live solo, I’d leave and we could actually meet another time without cameras. She looked panicked and said, “If I bail on the ‘first date’ angle now, they’ll pull the comp and I’ll be out a couple hundred. It’s not like I’m secretly filming you; chat doesn’t know your name or anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her I’m a teacher, my students follow trending lives, and I have a nutty parent who once tried to add me on Facebook. I also have an ex who stalked my socials a few years ago; I don’t mess around with this stuff. She said, “Then don’t say your name and don’t face the camera. I’ll keep you out of frame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was feeling cornered. I reminded her I’d said “as long as I’m not in it,” and she said “you aren’t in it.” I replied that audio and my words are also “in it.” She rolled her eyes and said, “Men act like my job is pretend until there are consequences for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point our gyoza hit the table. I asked her one more time to pause the live so we could talk. She said she couldn’t without “destroying her retention.” So I told her I was going to bow out. I flagged the server, asked for separate checks for what had arrived, paid for my drink and half the appetizer, tipped 30% because I felt like a headache, and left. I said, “Text me if you want to try again without cameras.” She didn’t respond then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that night I got a wall of texts. She said I humiliated her live, the sponsor pulled the comp, she had to pay full for everything (including my ramen that arrived after I left), plus the sitter, and I “owe her at least $150” since my “tantrum” caused her to lose money. She also posted a story (my face not shown) calling me “a guy who can’t handle dating a woman with a job” and some of her followers DM’d me (I didn’t share my handle; I guess they found me from Hinge + mutuals).\n",
      "\n",
      "I pointed out I’d clearly stated I didn’t want to be on camera and I offered to reschedule, and that I paid for what I consumed. She said I agreed earlier when I texted “do your thing” and “as long as I’m not in it,” and that being off-frame counts. I said off-frame is not the same as being recorded and broadcast. She said audio isn’t identifying and that I could have just avoided names and specifics for an hour to not sabotage her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I’m wondering if I handled it badly. Part of me thinks I should’ve stayed, kept answers generic, and had an actual conversation about boundaries after, or at least finished the meal so she didn’t get stuck with my ramen. Another part of me feels like the second I realized it was live, I should’ve walked before ordering anything. I never intended to mess with her income, but I didn’t consent to being content.\n",
