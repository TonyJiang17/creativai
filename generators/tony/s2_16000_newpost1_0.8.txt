Title: Wife has been working in “sales” 100% commission for the past 9 months. She hasn’t made a penny.

My wife got her insurance license last winter and joined a team that promised “unlimited income if you just show up.” It’s all commission. For nine months, she’s been in our spare bedroom from late morning until dinner with a sign on the door that says “Do Not Knock—Client Calls.” We have three kids (9, 6, and 3). I work an early shift and am home by 1 p.m., which means I’m the one doing school pickup, snacks, homework, and starting dinner while she’s “in the office.”

Here’s the problem: not a single sale. Not one. Meanwhile we’re paying for “exclusive leads,” monthly “agent academy,” and two different coaching subscriptions. The bill for her “business” is about $600–$900 a month depending on how many lead packages they convince her to buy. We can afford it for now, but barely, and only because I’m picking up overtime. It’s not even the money that bothers me most—it’s the way this whole thing has taken her away from the family without giving anything back.

I’ve overheard some of the “academy” Zooms because the walls are thin. They open with chants: “I am a closer. I am a leader.” The top guy brags about his Lamborghini and talks like a pastor. They keep saying things like “don’t let dream killers in your ear” and “if your spouse doesn’t believe in your vision, find new accountability partners.” When she didn’t hit some “rank,” they told her it means she wasn’t “coachable” enough. There’s a lot of love-bombing when someone buys more leads or recruits a friend. I tried sitting in on one call and got scolded in the chat for being “negative energy.”

It’s changing how she talks. She used to be the pragmatic one in our marriage. Now she tells me I’m “speaking scarcity” if I ask how many appointments she actually booked. I asked to see numbers—calls made, appointments set, sales attempted—so we could problem-solve. She said I was micromanaging her success journey. I suggested treating this like an internship with a set end date: three months, clear goals, then pivot if it’s not working. She accused me of not believing in her.

To be clear: I would be fine if she wanted to pause and be home with the kids again, or look for something salaried even if it paid less. It’s the pretending this is a full-time career while also outsourcing any parenting or household duty that’s making me resentful. Our 6-year-old asked why Mom doesn’t come to soccer anymore and I didn’t know what to say without sounding cruel. On top of that, I found out last week that she put a lead pack on our credit card after we said no more for the month.

I told her the whole thing feels culty. The chanting, the “cut off negativity,” the constant “buy more training,” the way they encourage working through dinner and weekends and label normal boundaries as “comfort zone.” She said I was insulting her community and belittling her growth. She also says the personal development has helped her confidence and she’s learning to handle rejection. I can see that—she is bolder. But we still need childcare covered and bills paid and a partner present at dinner.

I’m exhausted from being both the only earner and the default parent from 1 p.m. on. I asked her to either (1) stop buying leads, scale the hours back, and contribute at home, or (2) put actual metrics in place with a hard stop date and agree to quit if nothing changes. She’s furious and says I’m sabotaging her right before her “breakthrough month.”

Am I the asshole for comparing her team to a cult and insisting on boundaries and a deadline, even if she says this “season of grind” is temporary?

Idea:MLM-adjacent “agent academy” culture that looks and feels culty
