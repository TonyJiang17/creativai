title: AITA for not telling my family about my pregnancy?

AITA for not telling my family about my pregnancy?

I’m 40F and learned I was pregnant way, way late. My fiancé (40M) and I have always been upfront that parenthood wasn’t our path. After a lot of crying and a few sessions with the agency’s counselor, we decided on adoption. We’ve been doing the appointments, getting the medical stuff in order, and were just matched with a couple who are over the moon. I’ve told only two relatives I trust because my family tends to turn everything into a committee.

Here’s the conflict: The couple we matched with is wonderful and wants a semi-open adoption—letters and photos through the agency, updates a few times a year. I agreed to that. But last week they asked for something extra: they’d like to meet my parents and siblings, even briefly, to get a sense of family history and traditions for the child’s “lifebook.” Not asking for names or social media, just a coffee, a quick hello. They said it helps them answer the inevitable “who do I look like?” questions and fill in the cultural pieces they can’t provide.

On paper, it’s sweet. In practice, it would detonate my life. My family is deeply opinionated and religious, and the second they hear “pregnant” they’re going to show up at my door with a bassinet and a christening date. They’ve told me my whole life that motherhood is non-negotiable and that adoption is “giving away blood.” I can already hear my mom: “You’ll change your mind once you see the baby.” I’ve kept this private specifically to avoid that tidal wave of pressure. I explained all of this to the agency and the couple and offered alternatives: a detailed medical history, baby photos of me and my fiancé, a letter about our favorite foods/holidays/family stories, even a recorded audio message they can play for the child later. I will absolutely pour my heart into the lifebook for the child—but I don’t want a meeting.

The adoptive mom got quiet and said she respected my boundaries, but she worries their future kid will feel like a ghost around my side of the family—no faces, no voices, no texture—and that it could affect their attachment later. The adoptive dad added that my fiancé’s family isn’t local either, so the child may grow up with nothing but a medical checklist on that half of their identity. The agency gently floated a compromise: a moderated video call with my two trusted relatives, first names only, no details that could identify anyone beyond that. My fiancé thinks we should consider it, because he says the kid’s future questions matter more than my discomfort today. He said, “This isn’t about pleasing your family; it’s about giving the kid breadcrumbs.” I got defensive and said there are other ways to provide breadcrumbs that don’t blow up my boundaries.

Now the agency is hinting that if we can’t agree on even a minimal introduction, the couple may choose a different match. I get it—they have to do what’s right for their future kid. But I’m also due soon, and the thought of telling my mom I’m pregnant solely so she can do a sanitized Zoom for people she doesn’t know feels like opening a door I can’t close. If she pushes, I’m not strong enough right now to withstand it. I’m trying to make a decision I can live with postpartum, when I’m exhausted and emotional.

So, AITA for refusing the extended-family meet despite knowing it might cost this match? Am I prioritizing my comfort over the child’s long-term identity needs? Or is it reasonable to say my privacy and mental health during this pregnancy matter too, especially when I’m still offering robust information for the lifebook?
