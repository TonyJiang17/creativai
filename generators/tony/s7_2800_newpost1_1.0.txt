Title: Aitah for giving my stepdaughter a reality check?

My husband and I are late 30s/early 40s, and his daughter (16) is pregnant. Her boyfriend is 18 and away at college. He’s not responding to her calls, and his parents quietly moved out of the district. She says she’s keeping the baby. I’m not her mom, more like “dad’s wife,” but we’ve been cordial since I met her at 14.

Lately she’s been texting me nonstop and hanging around the kitchen while I work from home. After a week of small talk, she finally asked: could I keep her baby on school days “since I’m home anyway”? I run a small business with client calls and I have toddler twins. I told her I can’t become a full-time caregiver. She got teary and said when I had my kids people brought meals, did school pickups for my older nephew, etc., and she expected similar support. I tried to explain that occasional casseroles are not the same as daily daycare.

She insisted I “don’t get it” and said new moms just sleep when the baby sleeps, and she’d “mostly” do nights if I took days. My husband and I had been trying to show her the math (costs, waitlists, her school schedule), but it wasn’t landing. So I proposed something probably stupid: a “newborn night shift” drill at our house. One night. She’d sleep in the guest room with a weighted practice doll from a friend who teaches child development. Alarms every two hours for feeds/diapers, plus a couple of “cluster feed” alerts. I told her if she made it through and still felt totally confident, great. If not, we’d talk to her school counselor about on-campus resources and alternatives. She agreed, almost defiantly.

It did not go well. The first alarm went off at 11:30. She groaned and stayed in bed. I reminded her, and she shuffled up, “fed” the doll, and fell back to sleep with the alarm still chiming. At 1:40, I woke to her crying that she had a math test and this was “sabotaging her GPA.” At 3:15, she begged me to take “just one feed.” I said this was the point—if she wants to keep her days for school, nights will be hers. By 5:00 a.m., she was sobbing that it was cruel and that I was trying to scare her into giving the baby away.

The next morning she blasted me on Snapchat for “tormenting a pregnant minor.” Her mom called my husband, furious that I’d “traumatized” her. My husband admitted he okayed the idea but then told me I went too far in execution. Now his daughter won’t look at me. She told him, “If she really loved me she’d help.”

I told her again: I’m not available for daily childcare. I will help with rides to prenatal visits, budget planning, calling actual daycare centers for quotes and waitlists, and finding out what her high school offers for teen parents. I’ll help her talk to the guidance office about credit recovery if she’s sleep-deprived. But I won’t be the default.

She says I humiliated her and made her feel alone. I feel like I showed her one hard night before months of harder nights, and I’d rather she learn in a safe place than after the baby is born with no plan.

So, AITA for staging a “newborn night shift” drill as a reality check and for holding the line on babysitting?
