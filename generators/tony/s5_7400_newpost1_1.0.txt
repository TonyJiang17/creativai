Title: So I told my wife that our marriage isn’t the right fit for me anymore when she took sex off the table. AITAH?

We’ve been together 12 years, two kids (8 and 5). After our second was born and some medical stuff she went through, our physical connection basically disappeared. I’ve done the dishes, the bedtime routines, planned date nights, let her sleep in on weekends. I’m not perfect, but I’ve tried to meet her where she is. Meanwhile I’m touch-starved. We’ve averaged maybe three intimate moments a year for the last four years, and most of those felt like I was asking a favor.

Last month, our counselor suggested we stop negotiating about sex so it doesn’t feel transactional. My wife latched onto that and told me she wants to remove intimacy from our relationship indefinitely while she “figures out” her desire. She asked me to do individual therapy to learn to handle my urges without involving her at all.

I sat with it. I don’t want pity or obligation. I also don’t want to be the guy guilting his partner. But I’m a human being who needs affection and a sexual bond in a romantic partnership. I kept thinking: if she’s saying she can’t offer that, and I’m saying it’s a requirement for me, aren’t we at an impasse?

I didn’t want to blow up our family, so I proposed what I called an “ethical pressure release.” I suggested an open marriage trial period—six months, like a timeshare. I literally drafted a Google Doc with rules: everyone gets tested; no bringing people to the house; no overnights when the kids are home; weekly check-ins; full transparency; immediate shutdown if either of us is distressed. The goal was to keep our home stable while we both explore what we need. Maybe she’d feel less pressure and her desire might even come back. If not, we’d have data to decide next steps.

She lost it. Said I was gamifying our marriage, that the Google Doc was “gross,” and that I was coercing her. I told her she had already closed the door on sex with me and was asking me to live like a monk indefinitely. I’m trying not to cheat and trying to be honest. She said if I truly loved her I’d wait “as long as it takes” and learn to live without that part of a relationship.

That’s when I said, calmly, that if emotional partnership and co-parenting are all she’s offering, then this marriage might not be right for me anymore. I thanked her for being clear about her boundaries. I said I need a relationship where physical affection exists, and if that can’t happen here, we should plan a separation in a way that keeps the kids okay and finances fair. We have a prenup. I’m not trying to take her for a ride. I’m trying to stop bleeding out slowly.

She’s furious and says I blindsided her. She says I wasn’t “curious enough” about the reasons behind her low drive, that I made her feel like a problem to be fixed. I’ve spent years being gentle, reading books, being patient, doing therapy, not complaining publicly. I’m not mad at her anymore; I just realized we want incompatible things from a romantic partnership.

I’m not saying she owes me sex. She doesn’t. But do I owe it to the marriage to keep living like a buddy/roommate forever? Am I the asshole for proposing an open marriage trial and, when that was a hard no and intimacy is indefinitely removed, saying the marriage isn’t a fit for me?

Idea:AITA for suggesting an open marriage “trial period” like a timeshare and drafting ground rules in a Google Doc?
