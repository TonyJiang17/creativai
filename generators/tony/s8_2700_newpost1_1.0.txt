title: AITA for not telling my family about my pregnancy?

AITA for not telling my family about my pregnancy?

I’m 40F and I’ve been very consistent my entire adult life: I didn’t want kids. My fiancé (40M) was on the same page. Between BC, a medical condition that scrambles my hormones, and a medication that blunted symptoms, I didn’t realize I was pregnant until the third trimester. It wasn’t a joyful movie moment; it was a panic spiral. We talked with a reputable agency, got counseling, and decided on adoption. We truly believe this kid deserves to be raised by people who deeply want that role—and that isn’t us.

Here’s where it gets messy. I only told two relatives I trust to keep things low-key. The rest of my family is very church-centered and tends to swarm when they think they know what’s best. We planned to tell them after placement to keep the pressure off.

Last week, my fiancé picked up my prescriptions at a small pharmacy near our house. A tech there recognizes my last name because she goes to my aunt’s church. He also grabbed the prenatal vitamins my OB recommended and some iron. Apparently that was enough bread crumbs. That night, a “prayer request” went out: “Please lift up OP and her unborn child—urgent needs.” My aunt tagged my mom, cousins, and half the town. By morning my phone was a disaster—missed calls, voicemails, texts, and people I haven’t spoken to since high school sending baby gift links.

I called my aunt and told her to take it down. She said a “friend at the pharmacy” mentioned it and she felt “led by the Spirit” to share. I asked her why she thought broadcasting my medical situation without my consent was okay. She said it “isn’t medical, it’s life.” My mom then showed up at our door with a crocheted blanket from my grandmother and a whole plan: she’d move in for a month to “help,” we’d do a christening, and “once you hold the baby you’ll change your mind.” I told her we are proceeding with adoption and we’re not taking visitors. She burst into tears and said I was ripping her heart out and that “God wouldn’t have sent this baby if you weren’t meant to be a mother.” I told her I’m not changing my mind and they need to stop contacting me.

Now the group chat is full of “we’re only trying to help,” “adoption is selling your baby,” and “your fiancé is manipulating you.” One cousin called my workplace to “check on me,” which was humiliating. I’ve blocked several numbers and set my social media to private. My two trusted relatives are telling everyone to back off, and they’re getting accused of “enabling.”

I’m thinking about filing a complaint against the pharmacy because even if no one said “OP is pregnant,” that tech connected dots and it spread from there. My fiancé supports this but worries it’ll be a nuclear option and blow up the town politics even more. I feel sick that something as vulnerable as giving birth is now a spectacle on a church Facebook page. We are still committed to adoption and have asked the agency for extra security measures at the hospital.

So, AITA for not telling my family in the first place and for going scorched earth now (blocking people, threatening a complaint, shutting everyone out of the birth and adoption)? Part of me feels guilty because I know my mom is excited and thinks she’s fighting for her grandchild. Another part of me knows if I cave even an inch, they’ll swarm the hospital, and I’ll be bullied at the most physically and emotionally intense moment of my life.
