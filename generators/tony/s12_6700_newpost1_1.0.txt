title: AITAH for not caring that my ex best friend is dying?

AITAH for not caring that my ex best friend is dying?

I got a call from a lawyer last week that threw me back into a story I thought I’d shelved forever. Backstory: my childhood best friend and my then-fiancée had a two-year secret relationship. While pretending to stand up as my best man, he was also supposedly helping her plan a “marry, break me, bleed me” scheme—marriage, quick divorce, and trying to put me on the hook for assets so they could walk away with my house and savings. I found messages, detonated the engagement, and shut both of them out. He sent apologies, I blocked, she married him anyway. I moved on, married someone kind, rebuilt my life, and honestly, the rage cooled into…nothing. Like a dead radio station.

His mom came by recently and told me he’s terminal. She was teary but very clear that she never approved of what they did. She asked me to consider hearing him out. I declined. I’m not angry anymore; I just don’t have anything left for him. He’s not my person.

Then the lawyer. Apparently my ex-friend updated his will. He left me his house. The same friend who once plotted to strip me of my home is now leaving me the one he shares with my ex. The will even spells out that it’s him “making right what I once tried to take.” His mom swears he didn’t tell the wife—my ex—until recently. Now she’s texting me from unknown numbers, demanding I renounce the inheritance. She says it’s “obscene” that I would profit from a dying man’s remorse and that I’m “kicking a widow while she’s down.” She says he made that change while on heavy meds, though the attorney says it was notarized months ago, before things got dire.

My wife’s reaction has been complicated. She wants nothing to do with my ex, but she also hates the idea that accepting the house ties us back into their chaos. She’s worried we’ll get dragged into probate battles and public drama. His mom, meanwhile, is urging me to accept it because she doesn’t want her daughter-in-law to keep the home she “built on betrayal.” (Her words.) To be clear, I do not need the house. We’re stable. It would be a windfall, but not life-changing. It would also mean displacing my ex-fiancée after he passes, because the will places the home straight to me—no life estate, no conditions.

I haven’t spoken to him. I don’t want a deathbed confession, a filmed apology, or some big reconciliation arc. I don’t hate him. It just feels like a stranger left me a very expensive apology, and the person married to that stranger wants me to give it back so she doesn’t lose everything after burning me once already.

If I accept, am I petty for taking a house that symbolizes what they once tried to pull? Or am I respecting his final decision and staying out of it emotionally? If I refuse, am I enabling the exact person who helped plot my financial ruin? Is refusing the ethical choice or just me letting them rewrite history one last time?

I’m not looking for revenge. But I also don’t feel any obligation to soften their landing after the way they set mine on fire. I keep thinking: if I had never discovered their plan, where would I be now? Maybe that’s what he was trying to answer with the will. Maybe it’s one last manipulation. I can’t tell anymore.

AITAH if I accept the house?

Idea:He bequeaths you the house he and your ex planned to steal—AITA for accepting?
