AITAH because I'm frustrated our neighbors Autistic adult son steals our bottles and yard supplies...

We moved to a quiet street last year. Our next-door neighbors have an adult son who’s on the spectrum and has a support worker during the day. He’s pleasant and says hi, but there’s a pattern that’s wearing us down: things from our yard keep disappearing or getting rearranged. Snow shovels vanish mid-storm, rakes migrate to the other side of the fence, our refundable bottles go missing, and once our small dog was let inside our house by him because he “doesn’t like dogs.” We’ve had multiple calm conversations with his parents and with the worker. We put a “please don’t enter” sign on our gate. They put up a sign on their side too. It still keeps happening.

Two weeks ago a windstorm knocked branches into our front yard. We stacked them by the curb to schedule pickup. The next morning they were neatly piled in our backyard instead, which ruined the scheduled pickup and we got a warning from the city about obstructing the alley. Then last week we had another snow dump. We left two shovels by the porch, went inside to get the kids’ gloves, and came back out to nothing. We had to borrow from a neighbor and I was pretty embarrassed.

We put a camera on our porch after our gate was left ajar and our toddler made it halfway down the walkway while I was wrestling the stroller. The camera caught their son darting into our yard, grabbing the shovels, and leaving with our bottle bin tucked under his arm. You can see him glance at the camera and move quickly. We texted the parents and they apologized, said they’d bring everything back that evening. Nothing came back that night and it kept snowing.

I made what is probably a dumb decision: I posted a short, blurred clip to our neighborhood Facebook group. I didn’t include names, addresses, or faces (I used the blur tool), and I asked for advice on how to set a boundary that’s compassionate and effective. I figured someone might have dealt with something similar and have ideas beyond locks and signs.

It blew up. Half the comments were practical (lock your gate, tool cabinet, talk to the agency). The other half accused me of humiliating a vulnerable adult even if I blurred the video. Someone recognized their fence and tagged the mom anyway. She messaged me immediately saying I was cruel, that her son was mortified and fixated on the video count. The support worker’s supervisor emailed me asking me to remove it because it created “community stigma.” I took it down within an hour, but it had already been shared and a couple neighbors DM’d me saying their tools had also wandered off and they suspected the same person.

Now our relationship with the family is ice cold. The dad told me I “turned the whole block against” his son. I tried to explain I wasn’t trying to shame him, just get advice after months of missing items and open gates. He said if I cared, I would have kept it between us.

I feel awful that I added stress to their lives, but I also feel like I’ve been the only one dealing with concrete consequences: paying to replace tools, running out during storms, re-securing my gate so the kids and dog stay in, and getting notices about debris. I did blur and remove it quickly, but the damage is obviously done. AITA for posting the clip to crowdsource solutions when it involved their adult son who is disabled?
