Title: AITAH for refusing to go to the gym?

I’m 31F, my boyfriend is 37M, and we’ve been together for a year. We moved into an apartment complex with a decent little gym: treadmills, a squat rack, dumbbells to 60, enough to get a sweat on without leaving the building. I work a full-time medical job, pick up weekend bartending shifts, and am working through prereqs for nursing. Money is tight and my calendar looks like bingo.

He bartends and does a side gig, and his happy place is a luxury gym across town that runs $170/month. He’s been a member forever and it’s basically his community: he knows the trainers by name, swaps protein recipes with guys in the locker room, and posts check-ins on his story. Cool. I don’t knock it.

Where we crashed: he told me that for him, a non-negotiable is dating someone who “pushes themselves,” which in practice meant me joining his gym. I asked if we could just lift in the building gym since it’s free and I literally pass it on my way upstairs. He wrinkled his nose and said it “doesn’t have the right vibe.” He later said out loud that the apartment gym feels “cheap” and “full of people who don’t really care.” That stung, because the people in there are my neighbors—teachers, servers, retirees.

He offered a deal: he’d step up on chores and errands if I commit to his gym three times a week. I said I can’t afford that membership and it doesn’t make sense to pay when we have equipment downstairs. He said he’d cover the first month, and if I loved it, I could “rearrange priorities” to make it work. I tried it. The place is nice, I won’t lie. Showers smell like eucalyptus, the lighting is flattering, and they hand you a chilled towel. It also took me forty minutes round trip in traffic, and I was walking in the door at 9 p.m. to make dinner and study.

After two weeks, I didn’t hit his three-times-a-week quota. Between a double shift and an exam, I used the apartment gym once because it was 8 p.m. and I just needed twenty minutes near my own shower. He was annoyed and said he “didn’t pay for me to use a hotel fitness room.” He also refused to spot me downstairs because “it’s depressing in there.” I asked if he’d go with me just this once, and he said he has standards for his environment and I should too.

We had a blow-up when he came home from his lift, sat down to dinner I cooked, and commented that I’m “settling for low-tier equipment and low-tier results.” I told him flatly that calling our communal gym low-tier is rude and classist. He said it’s not about class, it’s about ambition—people who are serious invest in serious spaces. I responded that people who are serious about budgets use what they have, and that I’m not prioritizing eucalyptus towels over rent.

He then said he only agreed to take on more housework because I’d committed to his gym, and since I’m not following through, he doesn’t see why he should “carry the slack.” I pointed out that we both live here and dirty dishes aren’t a rewards program. He doubled down: if I cared about self-improvement half as much as he does, I’d make it happen. I said I’ll move my body when and where it fits my schedule and wallet—even if that means the “depressing” gym downstairs or a walk with the dog.

He’s now sulking and accusing me of disrespecting something core to his identity. I’m looking at my bank app and my planner and thinking: I’m not saying no to fitness, I’m saying no to a bougie membership and an attitude that looks down on the perfectly fine gym in our building. AITAH for refusing his gym when he thinks using the apartment one proves I don’t care?
