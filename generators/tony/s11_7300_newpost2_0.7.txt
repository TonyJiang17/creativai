Title: AITAH for walking out of a date?

I met a guy for the first time at a trendy izakaya because we both love skewers and sake. From the jump he had big “tell it like it is” energy. He stared at me, smiled, and said he’s into “very athletic builds” but “could be open-minded.” I said cool, we don’t have to be each other’s type. He laughed and said he appreciates “brutal honesty” and hopes I can handle it. Okay.

He flagged down the server and, without checking with me, ordered a “tasting spread” for two plus extra yakitori because “you can’t really know someone unless you share food.” I’d already mentioned I’m a light eater when I’m nervous, but whatever. We made small talk and it was fine until careers. I told him I’m finishing a series for a local art crawl. He launched into a spiel about practicality, hinting that creative goals are cute until you need to pay the mortgage. I let it go.

Then he asked if I want children. I said no, it’s a consistent answer for me. He leaned back and said that mindset is “a nonstarter” for him because he wants a big family and “most women change their minds anyway.” I told him that’s not going to be me. He said, “Well, that’s disappointing.”

I felt my whole body deflate. The food had just started arriving—plates upon plates I hadn’t picked. I decided not to sit through forty-five more minutes feeling judged. I told him, calmly, that we weren’t a match and I was going to head out. I called the server over, asked to split the bill by item, and paid for my cocktail, one skewer, the edamame I’d eaten, and tipped heavy because I know leaving mid-meal can be a headache for staff. He cut in to say it should be one check and we should “just split down the middle” because the table had already been set for the larger order. I said I wasn’t paying for food he chose without my input. He looked annoyed but didn’t make a scene.

I grabbed my coat. As I was leaving, he said, “You’re really going to leave me with all this?” I said it was his call to order for two. On the way home, I got a notification: a payment request from him for $84.16 with the memo “Half the tasting menu you bailed on + my Uber since you left me stranded.” I didn’t accept. He followed up with a text saying that even if we weren’t a match, etiquette says I should have stayed and split the bill.

Now my sister thinks I should have at least chipped in for half since I left early and the food was already in motion. My best friend thinks absolutely not—he ordered without consent, tried to make me eat on his terms, and I covered what I consumed plus a generous tip. I’m not trying to stiff anyone; I just didn’t want to pay for a guy’s dinner after being told I’m not his type and my life plan is wrong.

So where do the lines actually fall here? If you realize it’s not a fit mid-meal, are you obligated to stick it out and split everything, or is it reasonable to pay for what you had and go? Was walking out fine but refusing his Venmo request petty? AITAH?

Idea:Who pays when you decide to leave mid-date; etiquette vs self-respect
