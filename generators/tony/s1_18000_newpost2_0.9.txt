Title: because I won't tell my wife what my son/her stepson has in savings from my late wife?

My son is a junior and we’ve started the college gauntlet—campus tours, spreadsheets, the new FAFSA. He lives with me and my wife, so her income gets counted on the forms. She earns well, and I’m proud of her, but when we ran the calculators, our Student Aid Index shot up. Meanwhile, my son has money his mom left—part of a malpractice settlement and accounts she built for him before she died. I’ve always treated that as strictly his. I keep contributing to his fund and to my stepkids’ savings, but I’ve never told anyone the exact amount from his mother out of respect and a promise.

A month ago, my wife said we needed total transparency to plan for all five kids (hers, mine, and our two together). She wanted numbers for everything—529s, custodial accounts, inheritance, even what grandparents might intend—so we could “steer resources” where they’ll be needed most. I told her I’d share our household contributions and balances for the accounts we jointly fund. I would not disclose the inheritance amount from my late wife. She was hurt and said it felt like I was hiding something that impacts the whole family.

Fast forward to the FAFSA/CSS Profile chaos. Because she’s my spouse, her income is mandatory on the forms. Our SAI is way higher than we’d hoped, and aid offers will likely be thin. She’s furious that her salary “torpedoes” his eligibility, and says if she’s subsidizing the aid side, then we should at least know what my son has so we can plan what’s coming out of pocket without accidentally over- or under-saving for the others. She also floated the idea of moving money around—like transferring his custodial funds into a parent-owned 529 to change how assets are counted, or even shifting some to the younger kids “temporarily” to reduce the hit. I said absolutely not. It’s his money, and I’m not playing shell games with a settlement his mom intended for him.

Then came the ultimatum: she wouldn’t complete the CSS Profile for certain schools unless we “stop keeping secrets.” I told her I would not disclose a number that isn’t mine to share. We went in circles. I ended up sitting with our son and the guidance counselor to get the forms done correctly. We reported what we’re required to report—his student assets and our household income—with me inputting the student and parent info and her eventually adding hers because otherwise he’d lose eligibility entirely. Now she’s angry that her income makes college pricier while I “protect” a fund she can’t even know the size of.

She says I’m prioritizing a promise to my late wife over being a team. I say I’m protecting my son’s privacy and his mother’s legacy, and the real issue is the financial aid system counting a stepparent’s income. She thinks that if her money knocks down aid, the least I can do is open the books and consider using a portion of his inheritance for our younger two later to even things out. I won’t. I’ll budget more from our household for everyone, but I’m not reassigning or revealing money set aside for him by his mom.

So here I am: my kid’s aid is smaller because of my spouse’s income, my spouse is resentful because she’s kept in the dark about his assets, and I’m standing firm on a boundary I made years ago. Am I the asshole for refusing to disclose or redistribute my son’s inheritance even though my wife’s income is directly affecting his aid and our overall planning?
