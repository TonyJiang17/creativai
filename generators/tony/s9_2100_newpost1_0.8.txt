AITAH for never inviting my stepsister to my grandparents house when I know they make the most of their time with me and my brother?

I’m 16F. My dad died when I was little, and my brother (19M) and I have always been close to his side of the family. My mom later married a widower, and now there are four step-siblings in the mix (17M, 12M, 11M, and 15F). We all live together. The tension is specifically about my dad’s parents, who fought in court for visitation after my mom tried to pull back contact when she remarried. They won set days: three per month where they can pick up me and my brother and plan whatever they want.

Here’s where it gets sticky. The court document is oddly specific. It names me and my brother only and says no third parties on visitation time, except for pickups by parents/guardians. The wording came from some back-and-forth about my mom and stepdad trying to “combine” things, and the judge wanted to keep the time focused on me and my brother. So the order basically bans bringing along anyone else. It wasn’t written to be mean, but it’s broad enough that my grandparents are terrified of violating it because it cost them a lot to get those days in the first place.

My stepsister has begged to come with us for “girls’ days” my grandma and aunts plan (tea, museum tours, thrift shop hunts, art classes). She’s the only girl on her side, so I get why she craves that. But I don’t invite her. Partly because of the order, and partly because those days are my link to my dad and his family. They are limited and intentional. My grandparents are big on doing things with us instead of buying things, so it’s time that feels very…precious.

My mom thinks I’m being cold. She argues the judge can’t control who eats lunch with us or goes to the park and that “family is family.” She keeps saying, “If you wanted to, you’d find a way.” Last week she tried to force it. When my grandpa pulled up for our scheduled day, my mom told my stepsister to grab her bag and get in the car. My grandma panicked and said she can’t take someone else, citing the order. My mom blew up in the driveway, accusing them of treating my stepsister like a “stranger,” and then turned on me: “You could insist. You choose not to.”

My stepsister cried and asked me directly, “Why won’t you invite me?” I told her we have legal rules around these days and that I want my private time with my dad’s side. She heard, “I don’t want you,” and locked herself in her room. Now my mom is furious that I never try to make it happen, saying I’m prioritizing rules over empathy. She calls it cruel to know how left out my stepsister feels and still do nothing.

I do feel for her. But I don’t control the court order, and I don’t want to risk my grandparents losing what little they fought for. Plus, I don’t want to turn every connection to my dad into a blended-family compromise. My stepsister has her dad’s parents and her own traditions; our house isn’t the only place to find “girl time,” even if it’s not the same.

My mom says I should at least invite her to one of the days and “let the grownups sort the legal part out,” but that feels like setting my grandparents up for a trap. I offered to do something just the two of us on a different day—coffee and a craft market—but she said it doesn’t count if Grandma and my aunts aren’t there.

AITAH for keeping those days just for me and my brother and refusing to invite my stepsister, even though I know she wants in badly?

Idea:Grandparents-rights court order accidentally forbids bringing non-relatives on visitation days, but Mom keeps insisting anyway
