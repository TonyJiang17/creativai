Title: So I told my wife that our marriage isn’t the right fit for me anymore when she took sex off the table. AITAH?

I’m 38M, she’s 36F. Two kids. For years now, our bedroom has been quiet. She finally said out loud what we’ve both known: she doesn’t want sex right now and doesn’t know if that will change. She asked me to stop bringing it up so she doesn’t feel pressure. I respect her boundary, but I’m miserable living in a romantic partnership with zero physical connection.

I don’t want to leave our kids in a storm. I also don’t want to lie to them by pretending everything’s fine. So I proposed something that I thought protected them and gave us clarity: a “sleep divorce” with two small apartments on the same street. We’d still do school drop-offs, soccer, dinners together when it makes sense. But at night, we’d each go to our own place. The kids would see both homes as theirs; we’d rotate who has them when. The idea was to be honest about the state of our relationship without destroying our routines. And yes, we’d be free to date other people, because she has explicitly removed intimacy from our relationship with no timeline.

I ran the numbers. We could rent two modest one-bedrooms on the block behind our current house if we sublet our place for a year (we’re in a city where that’s feasible). No one would be moving miles away; we’d literally be neighbors. I framed it as a trial, with a family calendar for custody days and shared responsibilities. My hope was to avoid the bitterness of living together as resentful “partners” in name only.

She heard “you want a bachelor pad.” She cried and said I’m abandoning the family and teaching our kids that dads leave when they don’t get sex. I countered that I’m trying not to turn into a resentful shell who sleeps on the couch and snaps at everyone. I’d rather restructure than erode.

She suggested we just keep doing what we’re doing—same house, same bed, no physical intimacy “for now”—and maybe in a year reassess. I asked what would be different in a year. She didn’t have an answer beyond “less stress.” That’s when I told her I don’t think I can keep pretending we’re a romantic couple when that part is gone. I said if she’s not open to the neighbor-apartment plan, then we need to talk about a more traditional separation.

Now she’s telling friends and family that I’m choosing sex over my children. Her sister called me disgusting. Meanwhile, I’m the one packing lunches and doing half the therapy appointments and holidays. I’m not trying to disappear; I’m trying to create a structure where we can co-parent well without me slowly decomposing inside a platonic marriage.

To be clear: I don’t think she “owes” me anything. I’m also not willing to live this way indefinitely. I’m trying to choose the least chaotic path: keep our community, keep the kids’ routines, be truthful about what we are. She says it’s cruel and confusing to the kids. I think it’s more honest than fighting behind closed doors and pretending on Instagram.

Am I the asshole for suggesting the two-apartment sleep divorce and, when she refused and insisted we keep everything the same with intimacy removed, telling her this marriage isn’t the right fit for me anymore?

Idea:AITA for proposing a “sleep divorce” with two apartments on the same street so we can co‑parent but date other people?
