Title: AITAH for refusing to go to the gym?

I’m 31F and my boyfriend is 37M. We’ve been together just over a year and living together for about six months. The recurring fight in our place is… me not going to the gym enough.

For context: I’m not dealing with weight or health issues. I’m 5'5", around 110, and I move a lot for work. I juggle two jobs (weekday medical office, weekend bartending) and I’m taking classes to get into a nursing program. We also have two pets. When we moved in, I kind of defaulted into managing the house—groceries, cooking, laundry, vet appointments, remembering birthdays, all the little things you don’t notice unless they don’t happen.

He’s a bartender with a side hustle checking soda machines, and he’s been going to his gym forever. It’s his “thing.” A few weeks ago he told me it matters to him that his partner is focused on “self-betterment” and said he’d take on more chores if I committed to the gym. I asked if he had an issue with my body. He said no, it’s about mindset, not looks.

I tried to meet him halfway. I went to our apartment gym two or three times on nights I didn’t close at the bar. But I was still doing most of the invisible work: making lists, prepping meals, changing the litter, swapping laundry, booking the car inspection, texting the landlord about a leaky faucet. He started doing more of the obvious stuff—taking out trash, doing a quick vacuum—then would disappear to lift for two hours and come home to a hot plate and a clean counter.

After a blow-up last week, I did a nerdy thing: I tracked our hours for seven days. Not to trap him, but to figure out where time is going. I counted paid hours, commutes, school, chores, pet care, sleep, and “free” time. My week came out to 52 paid hours + 8 class + 10 studying + 13 house/pet stuff + 6 commute. That left around 8 hours of actual downtime for the entire week. He worked 36 hours at the bar + 5 on his side job + 6 at the gym + maybe 5 hours of chores. He had roughly 18 hours of unstructured time (mostly gaming and napping).

I showed him my little spreadsheet like a dork and said, “If we want me to add gym time, something has to come off my plate. Can we aim for equal leisure hours? If you get 18, I get 18. Or we split the invisible stuff evenly and I’ll go lift when you’re gaming.” He said I was being transactional about a lifestyle. He told me to stop micromanaging and just set my alarm earlier. He gets that I’m tired, but in his view “you make time for what matters.”

I tried one early morning. I was a zombie at my day job and cried in my car on my break because I still had to pick up dog food, return a package, review lab values for an exam, and prep for my double on Sunday. Meanwhile, he asked if I could make something “high-protein” for dinner because leg day left him starving.

When I told him I’m not signing up for his gym and I’m not sacrificing sleep to check a box he cares about, he said I’m disrespecting his standards and that he only agreed to do more around the house because I promised I’d start working out regularly. He keeps calling it “a simple hour” and keeps telling me I’m being lazy with excuses.

It feels like I’m being measured against a standard I literally don’t have the bandwidth for, and that the only solution he’ll accept is me stretching myself thinner while he keeps his routine intact. I’m not anti-exercise. I walk the dog, take the stairs, do a yoga video when I can. I just can’t sustain gym sessions on top of everything else unless the rest of the load changes.

So, AITAH for refusing to go to the gym when I can’t get him to look at the whole picture and balance our free time first?
