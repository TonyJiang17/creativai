AITA for not helping my parents during their financial troubles and telling them to get help from my sister instead since she gets everything from them and I get nothing?

Last year, after a decade of being treated like the “self-sufficient one” while my younger sister got a blank check, I set a hard boundary I call financial no contact. It’s not no-contact with them as people; it’s a rule that I don’t give, lend, co-sign, or exchange money with family. No “just this once,” no “we’ll pay you back Friday,” no “put it on your card and we’ll send you a transfer.” I made the policy because money had become the way I was guilted into pretending the past didn’t happen.

The past: when I was a senior, I begged my parents to complete the federal aid forms so I could apply for assistance. They refused—wouldn’t even fill out the parent sections. My counselor tried to advocate. They shut her down. I was told if I wanted higher education, I’d have to make it happen alone. I didn’t take on loans I couldn’t afford, so I went straight to work, took night classes I paid for in cash, and built up a tiny safety net over years.

Meanwhile, my sister never had to hear the word “no.” Car paid for. Rent paid for. Tuition, meal plans, spending money, spring break trips. If she wanted to switch majors or move apartments, the family ATM made it happen. The story was always that she needed “support” to focus on her future, and I was “independent.”

Two weeks ago, my phone lit up: my parents can’t cover their bills. Credit cards maxed out. They’ve been funding my sister’s final year and “didn’t expect everything to hit at once.” They asked for $1,200 to “get through the month.” I reminded them of my boundary and offered non-monetary help: I sent links to local resources, free budgeting classes, and a list of places hiring part-time. I said I would sit down to review a budget with them if my sister participates and they’re ready to make changes. I also said the person who benefited from years of support should be the first person they ask to contribute.

Cue the explosion. My mom said I’m “weaponizing boundaries to punish them.” My dad told me I owe them because “family is a safety net.” My sister called me heartless and said I’m “letting them starve,” then added that she’s “too busy with her thesis” to work and it’s our job to keep the roof over their heads “until she’s done.” When I repeated that I don’t mix money and family anymore, my mom sent a photo of their almost-empty fridge. I felt horrible, but I also remember being a teenager who couldn’t get her own parents to sign a form so I could try for aid.

Could I scrape together $1,200? It would drain most of the emergency fund I’ve been building month by month. I have rent, insurance, and a small cushion for if my car decides to die. I know from experience that if I break my own rule once, it becomes a constant negotiation. I don’t think I can go back to being the person who smooths everything over with my paycheck while hearing “don’t bring up the past.”

They’re furious that I’m sticking to “financial no contact.” My sister says I’m choosing savings over my parents’ wellbeing. I think I’m choosing to stop playing the role the family wrote for me—banker, fixer, the quiet one who doesn’t need help—and insisting they address the imbalance before there’s any conversation about money. I haven’t cut them off as people. I answer calls, I visit, I’ll help them find a food pantry or call the utility company about a payment plan. But I won’t send money or be their scapegoat when the person who has received thousands upon thousands can’t even pick up a weekend shift.

So, AITA for enforcing a financial boundary now that they’re in a crisis—especially when they refused to help me with the one thing that could have changed my trajectory?

Idea:“Financial no contact” as a boundary, like emotional NC but with money
