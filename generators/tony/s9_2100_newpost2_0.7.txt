AITAH for never inviting my stepsister to my grandparents house when I know they make the most of their time with me and my brother?

I’m 16F, and my dad’s side is a big part of how I stay connected to him. My brother (19M) and I spend scheduled time with our paternal grandparents—think day trips, little traditions, “experiences over stuff.” My mom remarried a widower and we gained three stepbrothers and a stepsister (15F). My stepsister really wants to join the “girls’ days” my grandma and aunts plan. I’ve kept those separate. It’s not to hurt her; it’s that this is one lane I want to preserve as-is.

My mom has been pushing hard for inclusion. I’ve tried to explain that these days aren’t casual hangouts; they’re intentional family time that comes from a complicated history. My mom says I’m punishing my stepsister for things that happened before she was even here. We’ve gone in circles.

Last month it blew up publicly in a way I did not expect. My stepsister posted a TikTok with sad music and photos of cute tea sets and cousins (faces blurred but the locations and outfits were recognizable to our school). Text overlay said: “When your ‘sister’ excludes you from girls’ days for not being blood, but says ‘family is everything.’” She didn’t use my name, but there were enough hints that people knew it was about me and my grandmother. The video took off locally—thousands of views, classmates stitching it, comments calling me a “Cinderella stepsister” and my grandma “elitist.” Someone tagged our school account.

I found out when a friend sent me the link and a crying emoji. By lunch, I had people in the hallway whispering that I’m cruel. A teacher saw it and sent us to the counselor because it had turned into a “bullying” situation—toward both of us, honestly. I was told to write a statement. My stepsister told the counselor it was “just her truth” and that she’s tired of feeling like a second-class kid. Meanwhile, my mom texted me from work: “This is why you should have included her. Fix it.”

I reached out to my stepsister privately and said we could do something just us—brunch, thrifting, nails—on a separate day. She replied, “I want Grandma and the aunts. That’s the point.” Then she posted a follow-up video saying she got offered a “pity hangout” and asking if she should accept “crumbs.” Comment section: chaos.

My grandparents don’t use TikTok, but my aunt does. She called my mom and said airing family issues online crossed a line. My mom snapped back that if they’d been more welcoming, none of this would be public. Now it’s an all-out cold war: my aunt wants to ban phones at girls’ days, my mom says that’s “controlling,” and my stepsister says she’ll keep sharing because “secrecy is how people get away with being unkind.”

I’m stuck. If I invite her now, it feels like caving to a public shaming campaign and dragging my dad’s family into a spectacle. If I hold the boundary, the reputation hit at school continues and my relationship with my stepsister gets worse. People keep telling me to “be the bigger person,” but being “bigger” seems to mean giving up the one untouched space I have that’s about my dad and the people who loved him.

My mom keeps repeating that I should stop calling her my stepsister and just say sister, and that words matter. Maybe they do—but if I change the label because I’m being pressured and blasted online, does that actually fix the hurt? Or am I just rewarding tactics that make everything uglier?

AITAH for refusing to invite her even after the TikTok and fallout?

Idea:A TikTok call-out video by the stepsister about “being excluded” goes viral and the school gets involved
