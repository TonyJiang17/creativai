Title: because I won't tell my wife what my son/her stepson has in savings from my late wife?

We’re a blended family in the trenches: my son is 16, her kids are 13 and 12, and we have a toddler tornado duo together. My first wife passed away when our son was in elementary school. During the lawsuit over her misdiagnosis, she wrote out a “letter of wishes” that came with the settlement paperwork. In it, she asked me to take a specific portion and lock it down for our kid’s education and early adulthood, keep it separate from household money, and most controversially, not disclose the balance to future partners to prevent pressure to “share.” She knew me well enough to make me put it in writing that I’d honor it, and I did—created the accounts, named myself as trustee/custodian, and have kept contributing.

My current wife knows I save for all the kids and that my late wife also squirrelled money away for our son. What she doesn’t know is the exact number. Recently, money’s been tight—appliance died, car repairs, her ex has been evasive about whether he contributes to their kids’ college funds. She suggested a full “let’s put every card on the table” talk. Not just what she and I contribute, but everything: my son’s inheritance, any help from grandparents, even hypothetical future gifts, so we can plan “fairly” and make a joint strategy.

I said I’m happy to talk about what we personally put aside and what we can afford going forward. I am not comfortable discussing the dollar figure from the settlement and the savings his mom left. That money is restricted by her wishes and legally earmarked. My wife’s response was that withholding the number makes her feel like I’m treating her as an outsider and that we can’t make big family decisions with blind spots. She also proposed combining everything into one family pool to be divided by need, arguing our younger two will end up with the least if we don’t “equalize.”

I told her that combining isn’t happening. She pushed harder—said it’s just a number and she’s not asking to touch it, only to know it exists. I finally showed her the letter. She read the parts where my late wife explicitly asks me not to share balances with a future spouse and to keep the fund insulated from household priorities. My wife put the paper down and said, “This is controlling from beyond the grave. You’re married to me now. We should decide what’s fair for all five kids, not obey a note written years ago.”

She keeps framing it as “our family versus a ghost,” and I keep saying I made a promise to a dying woman and a mother, and I won’t break it. I’ve offered transparency about everything we earn and contribute as a couple. I will not disclose or redistribute money that was set aside exclusively for my son by his mother. She says this means she can’t fully engage in planning and that I’m choosing secrecy. I say it’s boundaries and respect for a legacy.

We’re at a stalemate. She’s upset, I’m digging my heels in, and it’s starting to bleed into other topics. Am I the asshole for refusing to reveal or “family-plan” my late wife’s designated fund even though it’s affecting how my current wife feels about fairness for all the kids?
