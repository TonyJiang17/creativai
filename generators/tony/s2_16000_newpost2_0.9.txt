Title: Wife has been working in “sales” 100% commission for the past 9 months. She hasn’t made a penny.

Nine months into my wife’s commission-only insurance sales journey, our finances are stretched and our patience is thinner. She treats it like a standard workday—door shut, headphones on, “I’m on with a client”—but the scoreboard is brutal: zero sales. We’ve spent a few thousand on “exclusive leads,” coaching calls, software, and a headset that looks like air traffic control. Meanwhile, I work full-time, I’m home early afternoons, and I’m the one handling the kids until bedtime. I don’t begrudge childcare or chores; I resent the pretense that we’re a two-income household when we’re not, and the way this eats into family life.

We’ve had the same argument on loop: she says I’m being unsupportive; I say we need transparency. She thinks she’s “this close” to a breakthrough. I showed her our budget and it felt like the numbers just slid off. So I tried something different. I put a dry-erase chart on the fridge titled “WEEKLY FAMILY EARNINGS REPORT.” It had simple columns: Hours Worked (Mom/Dad), Income Received (Mom/Dad), Business Expenses (leads, subscriptions), and Net. I filled in my line from my paystub and wrote “0” under her income because that’s accurate. Then, under her expenses, I listed the lead purchases from the credit card statement. The plan was to update it every Sunday together so we could both see reality and talk next steps like adults.

She saw it before I got home and exploded. She said I humiliated her, that I wanted the kids to think she’s a failure. The kids did see it and asked questions—our 9-year-old read “Net” and said, “So Mom’s job costs money?” I froze and said, “Right now, yes.” She cried and said I weaponized the numbers to force her to quit. I said I was trying to make the invisible visible because talking wasn’t getting through. I also pointed out that I track my own overtime in the same chart. She didn’t care; she said pinning it on the fridge made it public shaming.

Her mom called me later to say I was controlling and that “not everything is about money.” I replied that food, rent, and childcare are. I also said this wasn’t meant for guests or social media; it’s our kitchen. She told me to take it down. I left it up for a week because I wanted to see if using it together would change anything. It turned our house into a cold war. She stopped eating with us, saying she felt judged every time she walked into the kitchen. I finally erased it when our middle kid asked if Mom was going to get “negative money” again.

Now I feel stuck between two bad choices: keep the peace and let the spending and time sink keep going, or be the jerk who forces a reckoning. I asked if we could set a 90-day runway with clear goals and a moratorium on buying leads. She agreed to stop leads for now but says the chart crossed a line and proves I don’t believe in her.

Was I the asshole for posting a blunt earnings chart on the fridge to force a reality check? Is that disrespectful, even if the numbers are true and the stakes are our family’s budget?
