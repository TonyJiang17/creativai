AITAH because I'm frustrated our neighbors Autistic adult son steals our bottles and yard supplies...

I’m trying to be compassionate here, but I’m exhausted. Our next-door neighbors’ adult son is autistic and seems to have a very specific routine around “tidying.” In practice, it means he enters our yard and relocates or keeps things that aren’t his. Yard tools, the bin of deposit bottles we keep on our deck, even tree limbs we pile for pickup get dragged somewhere else. We’ve talked to his parents and his daytime aide multiple times. They’re apologetic and say they remind him, but the behavior hasn’t stopped. We have two little kids and a friendly small dog, and the gate being opened is my nightmare scenario.

After yet another shovel disappeared during a storm, I bought a few AirTags and attached them to the handles of our shovels and tucked one inside the liner of the bottle bag. I figured if things walked away again, at least I’d know where they ended up. The next week, my phone pinged: the shovel moved, then the bottle bag, both crossing our property line and settling for hours in a garage-sized dot next door. Later that afternoon, the bottle tag pinged at the bottle depot down the road.

I didn’t set foot on their property. I texted the dad a screenshot and said, “Hey, it looks like our shovel and bottle bag are in your garage. Can you bring them back?” He responded that I was “tracking his son” and that this was invasive and creepy. I said I only tagged our items and I’m not tracking a person, just retrieving our things. He said their son is now anxious because he thinks everything around him has a tracker, and I’ve escalated a behavioral issue into a paranoia spiral.

The bottle depot part got messy too. I called ahead and asked if they could hold a bag with our name written on it if someone turned it in, since it was being taken from our deck. The manager said they don’t want to referee disputes, but if it’s clearly labeled, they’d set it aside. When the AirTag pinged there, I went with my ID. They had a bag with our address written on it and let me take it. Later that evening, the dad called, furious. He said their son does the bottles as part of his routine and that I’d embarrassed him at the depot and disrupted a calming activity. I pointed out the activity involves removing things from my property without permission. He told me I was “weaponizing technology against a disabled person.”

The next day at 10 p.m., both shovels appeared on our porch with no note. The aide left me a voicemail asking me to please remove all trackers, claiming it violates their privacy. I don’t agree—it’s our property—but now I’m second-guessing if AirTagging crossed a line. The tags have actually deterred more “tidying” because the phone alerts immediately when the gate opens and things move, but the neighbors barely speak to us now, and there’s an undercurrent of hostility when our kids are both outside.

On one hand, we’ve tried the polite route: conversations, signs on the gate, locks, reminders. On the other hand, I can see how the beeping and the depot refusing our labeled bag could feel like I’m singling him out. I just want our stuff to stay where we put it and our gate to stay closed. AITA for tagging our tools and bottle bags so I could retrieve them and for asking the depot to hold anything with our address on it?

Idea:AirTagging all yard tools and recyclables so you can retrieve them—AITA for “tracking” neighbors’ property once it crosses the fence?
