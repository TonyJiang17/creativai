title: AITA for not helping my parents during their financial troubles and telling them to get help from my sister instead since she gets everything from them and I get nothing?

AITA for not helping my parents during their financial troubles and telling them to get help from my sister instead since she gets everything from them and I get nothing?

Growing up, our house ran like a weird startup incubator. My parents “funded” my younger sister’s every idea on sight, while I had to pitch like I was begging a room full of investors. If I wanted anything beyond basic necessities, I had to put together a presentation and explain why it would “pay off.” The answer was almost always no. When it came time for college, I asked them to complete the federal aid paperwork so I could see what I qualified for. They flat-out refused. My counselor called them, they still said no. Their whole stance was, “you figure it out.” So, I did. I went straight to work, took a certification course I could pay for myself, and built a modest life, no debt.

Meanwhile, my sister was their unicorn. Brand new car at 17. Full-ride-from-parents to an out-of-state private school. Apartment furnished top to bottom. Monthly spending money “so she could focus.” When she wanted to switch majors, they celebrated the “pivot.” When she needed an extra semester, they extended the runway. They used credit cards and a home equity line to keep it all going. Every time I asked why the rules were so different, I got told, “She has potential. You’re independent.”

Fast forward to last month. I got a group text that read like a burn rate update: mortgage late, utilities behind, groceries dwindling. They wanted me to step in “temporarily” until they “caught up.” I asked how much they needed and what their plan was to repay. That apparently was an offensive question. My mom said, “We’re drowning; we can’t make a budget in crisis.” My dad said, “You’re the older one. Help your family.”

I told them I wasn’t comfortable pouring money into a hole I didn’t dig and don’t control. I said if they wanted my help, it would have to look like an actual plan: sister gets a job or contributes, they downsize expenses, and there’s a written repayment schedule. They were furious. My sister called me cold and said she “can’t work right now because of her thesis.” She also said my refusal is “punishing” them for old decisions and that “parents aren’t banks.”

Here’s where I might be the jerk: I told them they already made their investment choice. They went all-in on one kid, and the risk didn’t pan out the way they expected. Now they want me to be the bailout. I declined and said they should ask the person who benefited from the spending to help carry it. If she can’t or won’t, maybe it’s time to reevaluate the lifestyle everyone’s been trying to maintain.

For clarity: I’m not loaded. I have an emergency fund I’ve been building for years. I could probably cover one bill one time, but I know how this goes—one bill turns into rent, then tuition, then car insurance, then credit card minimums. I asked for transparency before I would consider anything (income, debts, a simple plan), and they called that “humiliating.” My mom sent me a photo of their empty fridge, and I felt sick. I also remember being 17 and crying in my guidance counselor’s office because my own parents wouldn’t even sign paperwork to let me try.

I’m not trying to be vindictive. I’d genuinely consider short-term help if they made it a family effort—meaning my sister contributes and there’s a real plan to change course. They don’t want conditions; they want no-strings money. I said no and told them to talk to my sister, since she was the one whose life they financed. Now I’m the villain in the family chat. My dad said he’s “disappointed in the man I’ve become.” My sister says I’m jealous.

Am I being unfair for drawing a line? Or is it reasonable to say, “I’m not your investor, and I won’t fund a strategy that already failed”?
