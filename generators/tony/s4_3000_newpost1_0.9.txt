AITAH for rejecting the names my stepdaughter suggested for my son because my husband and I know they're from her mom?

My husband (36) and I are expecting a boy in January. He has an 11-year-old daughter, “Luna,” with his ex. Their history is messy—there are medical records and an old police report from when he left, but court still landed on a straight 50/50 split. We keep it civil, stick to the parenting app, and don’t do personal contact.

Luna has been… lukewarm about the baby. She barely reacts when we talk about it, and then out of nowhere she arrived with a notepad of “brother names.” Every single one was from a franchise her mom is obsessed with. Think the level of “Harry/Ron/Draco” obviousness—but not that franchise. When I asked where the ideas came from, she shrugged and said they were just “cool.”

Later that night, my husband was helping Luna log into a school app on her tablet (we keep devices at our house separate from her mom’s) and a text preview popped up from her mom: “Don’t take no for an answer. Tell them you won’t bond with the baby if they don’t let you name him.” My husband didn’t snoop further; the preview was enough. It made our stomachs drop. We told Luna that we already have a short list and we won’t be using those franchise names. We kept it gentle and emphasized that her ideas are welcome, but we, the parents, have to love the name.

She went straight to my in-laws. They called us upset and said we’re making Luna feel unwanted. I explained the situation: it’s not about the names themselves; it’s about her mom using Luna as a messenger. I said we’d love Luna to help pick the first book we read to the baby or choose a special blanket—just not his legal name.

Two days later, my MIL tagged me in a public Facebook poll she created: “Help Luna name her baby brother!” The options? The same franchise names. She wrote, “Let’s show these parents how to include a big sister!” Hundreds of locals were voting. People I don’t even know were commenting. Someone even tagged the ex, who jumped in with, “Luna has impeccable taste, I hope her voice is respected.” Meanwhile, a cousin DM’d me screen caps where people were debating our marriage and calling me controlling. I was mortified—and furious. Also, safety? We don’t want our newborn’s name turned into a public spectacle before he’s even here.

I called my in-laws and asked them to take it down. They said I’m “overreacting to harmless fun” and that I’m “punishing a child’s excitement.” I told them crowdsourcing our kid’s name to strangers, on behalf of someone who has a history with my husband, is a line we won’t cross. I said if they won’t remove it, we’ll stop sharing baby updates with them because we clearly can’t trust what stays in the family. They refused. My husband backed me, and we both reported the post. It’s still up, just with the privacy turned to “friends,” which… still includes half our town.

Now Luna’s mad, my in-laws are accusing us of “alienating” her, and the ex is stoking it by telling Luna we’re “scared of her opinion.” I feel awful because I don’t want Luna to associate her little brother with conflict. But I also don’t want to reward manipulation or let social media pick our son’s name. We offered Luna other ways to be involved—shopping for a onesie, choosing a lullaby—but she says it “doesn’t count” if she can’t name him.

AITAH for drawing a hard boundary on the names and telling my in-laws to take down the poll or be cut off from baby info?

Idea:grandparents start a Facebook poll to crowdsource the baby’s name behind the parents’ backs
