Title: AITAH for walking out of a date?

Matched with a guy on an app after a few weeks of decent chats and decided to meet at a wine-and-tapas place. He greeted me with a big smile, gave me a once-over, and then said something like, “You’re pretty, your photos didn’t really capture your… build.” It wasn’t a compliment or an insult outright, just one of those comments that clings to you. I laughed awkwardly and changed the subject.

He asked about work. I told him I teach art part-time, sell prints, and I’m building a portfolio because long-term I want to show in galleries. He nodded and launched into a mini career counseling session. “You’re obviously smart—have you ever considered a data bootcamp? More stable money. Art is fine as a hobby.” I said I’m okay with the fact that creative paths aren’t linear, and I’d rather try than resent myself later. He insisted he was “just being real.”

We got through olives and patatas bravas. Then he hit the family topic. I said marriage isn’t off the table if it’s healthy, but I don’t see kids in my future. He pressed, asked if I was sure, told me he thinks it’s “concerning” when women say that because usually they “change their minds when the right man comes along.” That landed like a brick. I took a breath and said, “I don’t think we’re compatible.” I signaled the server, asked for my portion and a box, paid, and stood up to leave.

He blinked, looked genuinely surprised, and said, “Wow. Over a conversation?” I told him it felt less like a conversation and more like an interview where I kept failing. He half-laughed and said I was “reading too much into things.” I left anyway.

An hour later, I got a text essay. The gist: “I’m sorry you got upset, I didn’t say anything mean. You’re taking things too personally. I was trying to be honest so we don’t waste time.” No “I’m sorry I said X,” just “I’m sorry you took it that way.” He even added, “If you’re this sensitive, dating will be rough.” I didn’t respond. I blocked him the next morning because every time I reread the messages, I felt gross.

Here’s where I’m torn: My best friend says I did the right thing—if someone can’t speak kindly on date one, they’re not going to improve under stress. Another friend says people do awkward stuff when they’re nervous and maybe he meant well, like he wanted to lay out dealbreakers quickly. The comment about my body wasn’t outright cruel, the career “advice” could be seen as practical, and the kid conversation is something lots of folks want to clarify early. So I keep wondering if I bailed too quickly and then overreacted by blocking.

But the non-apology is what sticks with me. I can handle an actual “Hey, I shouldn’t have commented on your body or minimized your career; sorry.” What I got was, “You shouldn’t feel the way you do,” with a bow on top. That makes me think this would be a pattern: poke, minimize, then blame the reaction.

So did I jump the gun? Was walking out and blocking too much for a first date that just wasn’t a match, or did I just protect my peace when someone showed me who they are right away? AITAH?
