AITAH for not caring that my ex best friend is dying?

Four years ago I blew up my entire life because I found out my best friend and my fiancée weren’t just cheating—they were running a long game. He was smiling in tux fittings while texting her about how to set me up to take the hit in a divorce. When I confronted him, he had a lot of feelings and zero integrity. I cut them off, they got married, and I rebuilt. The fire in my chest eventually burned out to ash.

Last month his mom—who has always been kind to me—showed up shaking. He’s got terminal cancer. She asked me to consider letting him apologize. I said no. I’m not looking for closure. I’m not interested in being the final scene of his redemption movie.

A week later, at 2 a.m., my phone lit up: a hospital asking me to authorize a procedure. The nurse said I’m listed as his emergency contact. I told her that must be outdated, and she said, “Sir, you’re also the healthcare proxy on his advance directive.” My stomach dropped. Years ago, back when we were basically brothers, he filled out paperwork and put me down to make medical decisions. He never updated it.

Since then I’ve been getting calls about vent settings, whether to consent to a risky intervention, and, most recently, whether to change his code status. His wife—my ex—was in the room when one doctor called me. She was crying and begging, “Please don’t give up on him,” and then a minute later she was accusing me of trying to pull the plug out of spite. His mom wants me to keep decisions out of her daughter-in-law’s hands because she doesn’t trust her. The medical team says they can’t just hand authority to the spouse without either my formal refusal or a court order. They keep telling me, “We need someone to decide.”

I don’t want this power. I didn’t ask for it. The last big decision I made with this man involved choosing our prom suits. Now I’m supposed to decide whether to put his body through hell for more days he might not even be awake for. The guilt isn’t about him, weirdly—it’s about the nurses calling me at crazy hours, hearing a stranger’s oxygen numbers, and knowing someone’s son is waiting on my yes/no. I tried to sign paperwork to revoke my role and transfer it to his mom. Hospital says he has to be lucid to change it or I have to formally decline, in writing, which could delay critical choices. They asked for a decision on intubation while I was literally standing in the cereal aisle.

My wife thinks I should send a written refusal immediately and block the hospital’s number. She says it’s not my mess, and that any choice I make—fight or comfort—will be twisted by his wife as malicious. His mom says that’s abandoning him and that he chose me precisely because I would do what he would want, not what looks good. The thing is, I don’t know what he would want anymore. The person I knew would never have done what he did to me. Does that invalidate the promise I implicitly made by agreeing to be his proxy in the first place?

I haven’t gone to see him. I don’t plan to. But is it cruel to send in the revocation and let the chips fall, or is it crueler to keep making calls for a man I do not know anymore? I feel nothing for him, but I do feel something about being put in this position against my will.

AITAH for refusing to take the hospital’s calls and telling them to remove me as his decision-maker?

Idea:You discover you’re still his emergency contact and the hospital keeps calling you for decisions
