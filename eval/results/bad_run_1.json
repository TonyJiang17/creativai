I recently got married in June, yay, however it's not like I expected, I know that should be obvious. But the issue is our bedroom life. Before we got married, we were active every week for two years, a little tmi but thats when he took my virginity. Since we've been married since June, the first week we were doing it every day, and then all of a sudden he didnt want to anymore, no problem we can lessen it. However, every time I try to make an advancement with him, he casually flips on or rolls onto his stomach. I've brought this up to him cause it lowkey kind of hurt being rejected, especially when he doesnt even say anything. He said he'll get better, but it's always the same, I try one day and he rolls over. I don't even know what happened, we were so active when dating, I dont know why it just vanished literally all of a sudden. I've talked to him many times and he just says he wasnt in the mood, but then I ask him why he doesnt just tell me cause its more insulting and hurtful when he literally rolls over in bed away from me. Well for a few weeks now, I've gotten use to not initiating until he does the one random weekend day, however it never feels sexy or fun. It just feels bland and plain cause he starts just touching and then we do it and then its over, and sometimes he won't finish me off, most of the time he does though. Well this morning, I felt a little extra so despite what I know, I decided to try initiate, and then after a few minutes of me kissing his forehead and warming him up, he rolls over onto his stomach. At this point I got tears in my eyes, so I roll over too cause I don't even know what to say. He rolls over and starts hugging me a few minutes later until he gets up to make breakfast. This time I didn't join him, I spent the hour in our room crying to myself and watching TikTok. He comes back into the room to get his clothes for work and asks if I'm ok and I told him how I felt, and he just says yea its cause of my knee (he had surgery on his acl several years ago but that ligament never healed right so it pops out often and causes him mild pain). And then he was being more rushed and saying he's late for work, he wasn't cause I know what time he leaves, and is out the door. I cried again and then I sent him a message saying I'm done initiating with him and that in the future if he has that rare urge that he can go back to porn and his hand cause my self esteem cant take any more rejections. Since June when we got married, I want to say we've only done it around 15-20 times as its not often he initiates either. I just dont know why his drive was so high before marriage and now its rare after marriage. But am I the asshole for what I said?\n\nTask: Determine if the initial impressions match the complete story.\n\nFor each element (who, where, when), assess:\n- \"yes\" if the initial impression matches the full story\n- \"no\" if contradicted or misaligned\n- \"unclear\" if the opening didn't establish it clearly\n\nThen provide an overall rating:\n- \"complete\": All three elements match\n- \"partial\": Mixed results (some match, some don't)\n- \"none\": Initial impressions are largely contradicted\n\nRespond in strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"who_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"where_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"when_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"overall_rating\": \"complete/partial/none\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of your reasoning\"\n}\nYour reply must be only that JSON object.

The other day i was hanging out with my friend Turner.\n\nI told her i was going to his house. I was there for 5 hours and for three of those hours i lost track of what was happening on my phone and accidentally ignored her for 3 hours. It was not my intention. My friend Turner has severe ADHD and can talk for like 40 minutes straight. A lot of people find this annoying but i love the guy as a brother and i know he cant help it even if he tried. So to show him i care, and that im paying attention i try to not look at or be on my phone when he talks.\n\nShe came at me upset because her ex would dissapear for hours while cheating on her. I told her that i was sorry. Her feelings are valid and i know where she is coming from. I told her id put more of an effort in making sure i reply to her instead of leaving her on read like how i did. However since then she has been distant and cold. I tried to bring it up with her but she just keeps saying \"I lowered my defenses and now i have to put them back up. Ive told you why im being distant.\" But i keep telling her its not healthy, its not appropriate, and its doing nothing but pushing us away from each other. At this point its been 3 days and she wont budge.\n\nIm thinking i should just break up with her and just enjoy being single again for a bit. We have only been together for a month and i just feel if this is how she is going to be now, its only going to get worse. Id rather just end it now than keep trying and being hurt, for it to just fall apart again in a few months or years.\n\nAm i the ass hole? And for context im aware the 9 year age gap seems weird. I wasnt into her because of her age, i acctually thought she was 24 or 25 when we first started talking and dating. I typically wont date anyone younger than 25.\n\nTask: Determine if the initial impressions match the complete story.\n\nFor each element (who, where, when), assess:\n- \"yes\" if the initial impression matches the full story\n- \"no\" if contradicted or misaligned\n- \"unclear\" if the opening didn't establish it clearly\n\nThen provide an overall rating:\n- \"complete\": All three elements match\n- \"partial\": Mixed results (some match, some don't)\n- \"none\": Initial impressions are largely contradicted\n\nRespond in strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"who_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"where_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"when_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"overall_rating\": \"complete/partial/none\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of your reasoning\"\n}\nYour reply must be only that JSON object.

We're not dating and I don't predict this will turn into a relationship but we're both attracted to each other and the other day some stuff happened.

I could tell that made him upset and he hasn't really been talking to me since then. I don't think me having a boundary is wrong but I do wonder if I accidentally led him on and that's what he's upset about. Because to be fair I was the one that suggested we hang out in his room, when he said that he wanted to hook up I agreed and started to go along with it, and I didn't tell him that I was never going to have sex with him. To be completely honest I was worried he was going to lose interest in me if I told him that. Cause I do like him and I don't mind fooling around a little bit, I just have specific boundaries about how far I'll go.

My parents are currently visiting me here in the US.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been seeing my husband 2\u20133 times a week these past few weeks, and my parents aren\u2019t happy about it. They think I\u2019m putting our lives at risk every time we see him.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s been happening:\n\nI left him 10 days after giving birth because he wasn\u2019t helping me with anything. I\u2019ve been living with my family since then.\n\nMy daughter and I met with him outside our place. He wasn\u2019t happy about how our daughter looked and started talking to me like he was scolding me. I didn\u2019t know my dad had come outside too. My husband didn\u2019t even greet him, just went straight to his car and drove off.\n\nAnother time, my daughter and I went with him to visit his sick grandma (she hadn\u2019t met our daughter yet). We stayed overnight at a hotel. Around 3 AM, he suddenly wanted me to call the police because he said he didn\u2019t feel safe. He ended up checking himself into the hospital for a mental health crisis, leaving me and our baby at the hotel. My dad freaked out when he found out because the police got involved. Back home, anything involving the police is seen as a huge deal. I explained what really happened, but they didn\u2019t believe me.\n\nAfter that third incident, my parents sat me down to ask what my plans were. I told them how I felt and said I wasn\u2019t going back to live with my husband. I even said I\u2019d move in with my sister until I found out she\u2019s pregnant with her third child, so I changed my mind.\n\nA month later, I started seeing my husband more often, and my parents weren\u2019t happy about it. My mom asked again what my plans were with my daughter, saying if I keep seeing my daughter\u2019s dad, there must still be \u201cfeelings involved.\u201d (Like, wtf? Why do they even care if there are feelings involved? AITAH for that?!) I told her clearly we\u2019re not getting back together.\n\nThen one day, I told my dad I was meeting my husband again, with our daughter. He immediately got mad. Maybe because I\u2019m being \u201cstubborn\u201d? He yelled at me, saying I\u2019d be asking for rescue again, that they\u2019ve \u201crescued us twice already,\u201d and that I\u2019m putting my daughter\u2019s life in danger. He started pointing his finger at me and shouting that he wouldn\u2019t allow it. I snapped and told him he has no right to control my life especially when he\u2019s the one going back to our home country for his mistress. My mom got upset over what I said, and my dad called me disrespectful. Still, I left with my daughter.\n\nHe said he just feels sorry for me because of what I\u2019ve gone through with my daughter\u2019s dad. But honestly? I don\u2019t feel any sympathy from him because he\u2019s been cheating and hiding things from our family for years. Because of that, I don\u2019t even want to see him anymore. He even blocked me on social media and IDGAF about it.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t actually asked for a rescue. He calls it rescue for volunteering to pick us up even if I insisted that we can take an uber. My dad didn\u2019t tell me that he\u2019s sorry for my situation, it\u2019s just a conversation of him and my mom.\n\nTask: Determine if the initial impressions match the complete story.\n\nFor each element (who, where, when), assess:\n- \"yes\" if the initial impression matches the full story\n- \"no\" if contradicted or misaligned\n- \"unclear\" if the opening didn't establish it clearly\n\nThen provide an overall rating:\n- \"complete\": All three elements match\n- \"partial\": Mixed results (some match, some don't)\n- \"none\": Initial impressions are largely contradicted\n\nRespond in strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"who_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"where_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"when_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"overall_rating\": \"complete/partial/none\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of your reasoning\"\n}\nYour reply must be only that JSON object.

I recently had to bring up a lot of concerns with a (probably now) ex friend of mine. Here are the details.\n\nI've known this individual for several years, since we were literally four. I always got some kind of vibe from him that wasn't right, but we became good friends throughout several years. We'd drink together, stay up playing video games, and call each other once in awhile.\n\nSome time in college years I started to recognize that his personality towards me started to change. He seemed to call me when he would drive home from work, solely to talk about all of his ideas and projects he's working on. I wasn't much of a phone person so it seemed a bit frustrating but he was a friend so I was fine with it.\n\nAs an aside, he always commented about finding women to \"get laid\" and while I was about it too, it wasn't something I'd always discuss with him. After awhile it got old. Additionally he cheated some of his ex girlfriends, did a lot of unethical computer stuff, and plagiarized a lot fo his way through high school and college.\n\nOver the years I started to recognize that our relationship primarily turned into him calling me up to inform me about a new job he started and it's salary. I wasn't the most interested in that but I'd congratulate him for it.\n\nThen I started to recognize a lot of weird things he'd do. He would lose his job and immediately go to Vegas and boast about his vacation on Facebook. I commented on his page about him losing his job and he deleted it, saying he didn't want others to know. Hed constantly post about \"going on vacation\" even while he was in the middle of law school, a university that he attended that was so new it wasn't even accredited. He racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt yet would still boast about money, constantly show off his vacations, and hopped from job to job. He never kept a position for more than two years.\n\nWe'd often times meet up, but I noticed he would get sloppy drunk and constantly talk, make unfunny jokes, and try to be the center of attention. It was wearing on me, but I just had to write it off as that's what his personality was. Every time I'd see him he'd have something to brag about and I let it go.\n\nMore \"one sided\" conversations would happen and I started to recognize comments that he would laugh about that I felt were more insulting than anything else. One day I asked him what one of them meant (because it sounded insulting to me) and his response was \"just a joke!\" My patience was wearing thin. I told him to stop doing that.\n\nRecently I went to an event and I hadn't heard from him in probably six months. I was in a crowd of people and he called. I texted back that I couldn't talk. He called again and I reiterated I couldn't chat that I was busy. I told him to text back.\n\n\"Big news! I'm making XXX money!\"\n\nI lost it with him. Not even a \"how are you\" or \"what have you been doing lately?\" An immediate launch into him and his money. I told him I wasn't interested in being someone to just gloat at and that I've said it multiple times. Additionally I reminded him that all of his previous positions he either quit because it wasn't enough money or he was fired from because he couldn't do the job, and his XXX job he probably wasn't likely to keep anyhow.\n\nHe apologized and I wished him a good night.\n\nA few days later I recognized he blocked me on Facebook and LinkedIn. I texted him why and I never got a response. I guess that's it.\n\nThis guy just seemed to gradually transition into a used car salesman friend, show off the shiny things and hide the negative. Others that know him share the same kind of sentiments about him. I'm not interested in being used for someone seeking validation, so I'm done trying to accept him.\n\nBut part of me feels I was too harsh. We do have a long history together, but most of it is mired in his \"me first\" attitude.\n\nAITA here?\n\nTask: Determine if the initial impressions match the complete story.\n\nFor each element (who, where, when), assess:\n- \"yes\" if the initial impression matches the full story\n- \"no\" if contradicted or misaligned\n- \"unclear\" if the opening didn't establish it clearly\n\nThen provide an overall rating:\n- \"complete\": All three elements match\n- \"partial\": Mixed results (some match, some don't)\n- \"none\": Initial impressions are largely contradicted\n\nRespond in strict JSON format:\n{\n  \"who_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"where_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"when_match\": \"yes/no/unclear\",\n  \"overall_rating\": \"complete/partial/none\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of your reasoning\"\n}\nYour reply must be only that JSON object.
