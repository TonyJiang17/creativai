1. Characterization & Motivation
Scope: Defaults favor 1–2 on-page characters. If more appear but choreography and pressure remain clear, do not penalize headcount itself. Apply "relationships as crucible," "status dynamics," and "secondary pressure" only if those characters are on the page.  
Single-POV default: Evaluate interiority, embodied emotion, and micro-choices under pressure. Only if a second character is on the page, apply the relationship/status bullets; otherwise ignore them.
Single-POV baseline: evaluate interior contradiction, embodied emotion, and micro-choices under pressure. Apply relationship or status bullets only if another character is on the page.
Precedence note: If a closure choice feels unmotivated, score the causality break in Q2. In Q1, you may note this diagnostically without deduction.
- Motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits, and intensifies to compel higher-stakes choices as pressure rises
- Interiority is concrete and character-particular; no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies
- Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, not alternating summaries
- Emotions are embodied and contradictory, not performed; avoid therapy-speak or diagnostic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis
- Actions align with motives; reactions to key objects and ideas reveal character under pressure
- A meaningful change or credible endurance/renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost scaled to this length
- Relationships as crucible: relationships under pressure force choices that alter their state by the end (only if on the page)
- Secondary characters, if present, apply immediate pressure relevant to the central conflict
- Backstory/Reflection: see BRR
- Blind spots and limits drive inevitable mistakes that compound before resolution; competence is balanced with genuine struggle
- External behavior differs from internal experience in consistent, character-specific ways
- Thought and perception degrade appropriately under stress
- Knowledge stays strictly character-bound; misbeliefs persist until dramatized events correct them and distinct knowledge states create earned irony and conflict
- Characters remain genuinely flawed without safety-hedging; moral ambiguity is not artificially balanced
- Flaws complicate choices; the resolution may confront them or accept their cost (Earned Stasis)
- Characters read as individuals rather than stereotypes; traits are shown through speech, choice, and worldview rather than token cues
- Status dynamics are legible in dialogue and staging; power shifts under pressure (only if a second character is present)
- Micro-choices in difficult moments reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost on the page
- Emotional progression is realistic, with strong feelings layering and contradicting via credible irrationality (e.g., hypocrisy or self-deception) rooted in flaws, avoiding tidy resolutions
- Voice distinction: if two characters speak on the page, their speech and perception carry distinct idiom. Brief convergence at closure is acceptable if internal voice remains coherent and the effect reads intentional. Applies only when two characters are on the page; single-POV pieces are evaluated for internal voice coherence and specificity.
- Scope note: apply status dynamics and professional or occupational detail only when germane to the central conflict; do not require occupation-level exposition at this length

9+ quick test (Q1): contradictory impulses act in scene and the final choice or renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

Common Failures (anti-patterns)
- Label-only feelings or bodily clichés without specific embodiment
- Over-tidy, purely rational decision paths with no ambiguity
- Name, role, or pronoun drift; inconsistencies in biographical or capability details
- Recycled sentence stems for interiority and beats; voice convergence under emotional pressure
- Stock or one-note personalities used for convenience
- Knowledge leaps not earned by the scene or convenient amnesia of established facts
- Over-articulated, diagnostic label-speak in interiority
- Emotional summary that abstracts state with labels instead of embodied perception and action
- Gestural poverty repeated across the cast
- Traits that exist only as labels without altering speech, choices, or worldview
- Perfect emotional calibration where everyone reacts with textbook appropriateness
- Emotional arithmetic that resolves complex states into neat stages
- **Diagnostic label-speak in peak beats** triggers −0.4 to −0.6 in Q1 unless dramatized with embodied cost within 2–3 lines.
